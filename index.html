    <h2>Snape Game: Color Alonzo</h2>

    <p>“Color Alonzo” is a quiz-type coloring game intended to help children learn their different colors. When “Color Alonzo” begins, the user provides input through dragging paint bucket sprites onto Alonzo to color him specific colors. If these instructions are followed correctly, the program outputs a congratulatory message. If the wrong color is imputed, the program outputs a message telling the user that they chose incorrectly. Once the specified number of colors is cycled through, the program displays a play again button that the user can click to restart the program.

    <h2>Scratch Game: Apples!</h2>
    <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/720454356/">Link to Play Apple Game</a></p>
    <p>Through this program, I intended to create a simple game that allowed me to experiment with properties such as speed. I accomplished this by creating and manipulating my own variables in loop blocks. When run, apples appear at the top of the screen and begin falling to the bottom, gaining acceleration. This was done by creating a speed variable that increased the rate at which the apple was moving downwards as the apple’s y-coordinate came closer and closer to the bottom of the screen. To win this game, the user had to collect 25 apples in the basket by using arrow keys to move the basket left or right. I had difficulties with some of the sensing blocks used to reset my apples at the top of the screen. They were finicky and had to be rewritten a few times before they’d work. Through creating this program, I gained more experience with creating variables and applying them in practical scenarios. This project was also a great way to learn more about conditional “if-then” statements and loop blocks like the forever block.

    <h2>Fusion 360 Project</h2>
    <p><a href="www.google.com">Link to somewhere</a></p>
    <p>This project’s goal was to model a desk organizer using Autodesk Fusion 360 software. I accomplished this through utilizing a combination of sketch designs and various modeling tools. I had some difficulty assembling the sides of the organizer, but figured out how to do so after messing around with some of the constraint options. This project allowed me to practice constructing multiple planes and exporting files to 3D print.
